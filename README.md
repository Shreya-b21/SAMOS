# SAMOS
A SAMOS simulator using object-oriented programming concepts in C++ which showcases the major features like classes and objects, inheritance and polymorphism ,etc.
"Increasingly complex spacecraft missions require advanced simulation tools to ensure mission success. However, existing simulation systems lack the capability to accurately model the dynamic interactions between spacecraft subsystems in real-time, hindering the ability of engineers to optimize spacecraft designs and mission plans. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop a sophisticated spacecraft analysis and modelling system capable of providing real-time simulation and analysis of spacecraft behaviour under varying mission scenarios. This system should integrate advanced modelling techniques, dynamic simulation algorithms, and visualization capabilities to enable engineers to assess spacecraft performance, identify potential issues, and optimize mission parameters effectively."

    Spacecraft missions are becoming increasingly complex, requiring advanced simulation tools to ensure mission success. However, existing spacecraft simulation systems often lack the capability to accurately model the dynamic interactions between spacecraft subsystems in real-time, limiting engineers' ability to optimize spacecraft designs and mission plans effectively. To address this challenge, this research proposes the development of a sophisticated spacecraft analysis and modelling system, named SAMOS (Spacecraft Analysis and Modelling System). SAMOS aims to provide real-time simulation and analysis of spacecraft behaviour under varying mission scenarios, integrating advanced modelling techniques, dynamic simulation algorithms, and visualization capabilities.
